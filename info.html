            <li>Birthplace: Setagaya, Tokyo, Japan</li>
            <li>Occupation: Video Game Designer, Director, Producer, Writer</li>

            <li>Known for his cinematic storytelling and attention to detail</li>
            <li>His games were among the first to explore real-world issues and trends â€” from the diaspora of nuclear
                arms after the Cold War, to the rise of misinformation on the internet, to the ethics of the United
                States interfering in foreign countries during the Cold War</li>
            <li>At age 10 his parents would allow Kojima to go to the movie theaters by himself as long as he came back
                with a "book report"</li>
            <li>In his early years, his skillset was oriented more towards artistic expression over technical precision,
                so he struggled with the daily aspects of programming and design</li>
